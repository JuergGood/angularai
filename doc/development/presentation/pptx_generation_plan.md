### PowerPoint Generation System Ready

I have implemented a professional PowerPoint generation system that supports structured layouts, images, and automated styling.

#### 1. Presentation Workspace
All related files are in: **`doc\ai\presentation\`**
- **`presentation-plan.md`**: The source of truth for your slides. It uses a structured format to define titles, layouts, and content.
- **`generate_presentation.py`**: The Python engine that parses the plan and generates the `.pptx` file.
- **`files\`**: The directory for all images and diagrams referenced in the slides.

#### 2. Supported Slide Layouts
You can now define slides in `presentation-plan.md` using these layouts:
- `layout: title`: Main title slide.
- `layout: title_and_content`: Standard slide with bullet points. Can also include a centered or side-image.
- `layout: two_content`: Side-by-side layout. Perfect for text on the left and a diagram/screenshot on the right.

#### 3. How to include Images & Diagrams
The system handles images automatically if they are placed in the `files/` folder.

**Step A: Export Diagrams**
1.  Open your `.drawio` files in [app.diagrams.net](https://app.diagrams.net).
2.  Export them as **PNG** with transparent background.
3.  Save them in `doc\ai\presentation\files\` with names matching the plan (e.g., `architecture_overview.png`, `local_dev_setup.png`).

**Step B: Generate UI Screenshots**
I have updated the Cypress test `frontend\cypress\e2e\user-management.cy.js` to include screenshot commands. To generate them:
1.  Start your Backend and Frontend locally.
2.  Run Cypress: `cd frontend; npx cypress run`.
3.  Cypress will save screenshots in `frontend\cypress\screenshots`.
4.  Copy the relevant ones (like `login-page.png`) to `doc\ai\presentation\files\`.

#### 4. Final Generation
Once your images are in the `files/` folder, simply run:
```bash
python doc\ai\presentation\generate_presentation.py
```
This will produce **`doc\ai\presentation\AngularAI_Presentation.pptx`** with all your content and images perfectly positioned.

#### 5. Custom Design & Post-Processing
*   **Design**: The script currently applies a clean 16:9 layout. You can apply any PowerPoint Design Theme in one click once the file is generated by going to the **Design** tab in PowerPoint.
*   **Mermaid**: Use the Mermaid blocks in the `.md` file for quick previews; the Python script will use the high-quality `.png` exports from Draw.io for the final deck.

The current "Draft" presentation has already been generated and is waiting for your images!
